          <h3>Unmatched Local Knowledge</h3>
          <p>Our chauffeurs don't just know Brooklyn—they master it through daily experience. They know the fastest routes at different times of day, which intersections experience delays, where construction impacts traffic, and countless micro-efficiencies that GPS alone cannot provide. This expertise translates directly to shorter trip times and greater reliability.</p>
          
          <h3>Consistent Quality Every Trip</h3>
          <p>When you book with us, you know what to expect: a late-model luxury vehicle that's impeccably clean, a professional chauffeur in business attire, punctual pickup, courteous service, and smooth transportation to your destination. No wondering what kind of car is coming or who's driving—just consistent, premium quality.</p>
          
          <h3>Transparent, Predictable Pricing</h3>
          <p>We quote your fare upfront, including all costs. No surge pricing during busy times, no surprise fees at the end, no awkward conversations about tips. The price we quote is the price you pay, making our service easy to budget and plan for regular use.</p>
          
          <h3>True 24/7 Availability</h3>
          <p>Unlike rideshare services where availability fluctuates based on driver supply, we maintain consistent service around the clock. Early morning flights, late-night returns, midnight emergencies, holiday travel—we're available when you need us, with the same quality and pricing regardless of time or day.</p>
          
          <h3>Relationship Service</h3>
          <p>Many of our Brooklyn clients book us regularly and develop relationships with preferred chauffeurs. For clients who want this level of personalized service, we accommodate it—you can request the same driver who learns your preferences, routes, and expectations over time.</p>
