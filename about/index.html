          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Black Car Service New York was founded with a simple mission: provide the most reliable, professional, and luxurious ground transportation in New York. We recognized that busy professionals, corporate travelers, and discerning clients deserved better than the inconsistent service offered by rideshare apps and traditional taxi services.</p>
          
          <p>What started as a commitment to excellence has grown into New York's premier black car service. Today, we serve Fortune 500 executives, celebrity clients, foreign dignitaries, and anyone who values their time enough to demand punctuality, privacy, and professional service.</p>

          <p>Our success is built on a foundation of three principles: hire the best chauffeurs, maintain the finest vehicles, and treat every client like they're our most important client—because they are.</p>

          <h2>Why We're Different</h2>
          
          <h3>Career Chauffeurs, Not Gig Workers</h3>
          <p>Our chauffeurs aren't between jobs or driving to make extra money. They're career professionals who have chosen chauffeuring as their livelihood. They undergo rigorous screening, including criminal background checks, driving record reviews, drug testing, and in-depth interviews. Those who join our team complete extensive training in defensive driving, customer service, and executive protocol.</p>
          
          <p>The result? Chauffeurs who take pride in their work, know New York intimately, and understand that their job is to make your experience exceptional—not just acceptable.</p>

          <h3>Premium Fleet, Meticulously Maintained</h3>
          <p>Every vehicle in our fleet is a late-model luxury car: Mercedes-Benz S-Class and E-Class, BMW 7 Series, Cadillac Escalade, Lincoln Navigator, and Mercedes Sprinter vans. We don't operate aging vehicles with high mileage. When a car no longer meets our standards, we replace it.</p>
          
          <p>Each vehicle is professionally detailed inside and out before every trip. They're equipped with WiFi, charging ports, bottled water, and climate control. You'll never wonder what kind of car is coming—it will be exactly what you expect.</p>

          <h3>Technology That Works For You</h3>
          <p>We track every flight in real-time. If your plane is delayed, we know before you do and adjust your pickup accordingly. You'll receive automatic notifications with your chauffeur's photo, contact information, and vehicle details. Our booking system provides instant quotes and immediate confirmation.</p>
          
          <p>But technology never replaces human judgment. When something doesn't go as planned—and travel sometimes doesn't—you'll reach a real person who can solve problems, not an automated system that can't.</p>

          <h2>Our Values</h2>
          
          <div class="grid-2">
            <div class="card">
              <h3>🛡️ Safety First</h3>
              <p>Your safety is non-negotiable. Every chauffeur is licensed, insured, background-checked, and trained in defensive driving. Our vehicles are professionally maintained and inspected. We never compromise safety for speed or convenience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h3>⏱️ Punctuality</h3>
              <p>We understand that your time is valuable. Our chauffeurs arrive early, monitor traffic in real-time, and take the optimal route to ensure on-time arrival. When we say we'll be there, we'll be there.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h3>🤫 Discretion</h3>
              <p>What happens in our vehicles stays in our vehicles. Your destinations, conversations, and schedule are completely confidential. We understand that many clients require absolute privacy, and we deliver it without exception.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h3>✨ Excellence</h3>
