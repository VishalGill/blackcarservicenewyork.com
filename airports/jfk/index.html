          <h2>JFK Airport Transportation - Professional Car Service to John F. Kennedy International</h2>
          <p>John F. Kennedy International (JFK) is one of the primary airports serving the New York metropolitan area. Whether you're a business traveler catching an early morning flight, a family heading out for vacation, or a visitor arriving in New York for the first time, ground transportation sets the tone for your entire trip. Our professional car service provides reliable, comfortable, and stress-free transportation between JFK and anywhere in the region.</p>
          
          <p>Unlike rideshare services where availability fluctuates wildly and surge pricing can double or triple costs during peak demand, our airport car service offers guaranteed availability at transparent, fixed rates. Book in advance, know your exact price, and have confidence that a professional chauffeur will be waiting when you land—no matter what time your flight arrives, no matter what the weather is doing, no matter if there's a concert or sporting event causing surge pricing elsewhere.</p>
          
          <p>Our JFK airport car service includes real-time flight tracking, complimentary meet-and-greet service in the arrivals hall, generous wait time for flight delays or baggage claim delays, and professional chauffeurs who navigate JFK daily. Every terminal layout, every pickup procedure, every optimal route into the city—our drivers know this airport intimately and ensure you reach your destination efficiently and comfortably.</p>

          <h2>JFK Terminal-by-Terminal Pickup Guide</h2>
          <p>John F. Kennedy International consists of multiple terminals, each with distinct layouts, airline assignments, and pickup procedures. Understanding where you're landing and where to meet your chauffeur eliminates confusion and delays. When you book with us, we'll know your terminal based on your airline and flight information, but here's what to expect at each one:</p>
          
          <h3>Terminal Navigation Tips</h3>
          <p>All terminals at JFK have designated arrivals areas where our chauffeurs wait with name signs. After deplaning and collecting your checked luggage from baggage claim, follow signs to "Ground Transportation" or "Arrivals." Your chauffeur will be positioned in a visible location within the arrivals hall, holding a sign with your name clearly displayed.</p>
          
          <p>Before your flight lands, you'll receive a text message with your chauffeur's name, photo, vehicle description, and direct phone number. This allows you to contact them directly if you need assistance finding each other. Our chauffeurs also monitor flight status continuously, so they know if you're delayed and will adjust their positioning accordingly.</p>
          
          <h3>International Arrivals</h3>
          <p>International flights require additional time for customs and immigration clearance. We include 60 minutes of complimentary wait time for all international arrivals, starting from your actual landing time—not your scheduled time. This gives you ample time to clear immigration (which can take 20-45 minutes depending on how many flights land simultaneously), collect checked bags, pass through customs, and proceed to the arrivals area where your chauffeur is waiting.</p>
          
          <p>During peak international arrival times (typically early morning and late afternoon), the customs halls can be particularly busy. Our 60-minute buffer accommodates this, and if you're running even later due to exceptional circumstances, just text your chauffeur to let them know. We don't charge extra for reasonable delays beyond your control.</p>
          
          <h3>Domestic Arrivals</h3>
          <p>Domestic flights generally move much faster. You deplane, collect any checked bags from baggage claim (if applicable), and proceed directly to ground transportation. We include 30 minutes of complimentary wait time for domestic arrivals, which is typically more than sufficient. Most passengers meet their chauffeur within 10-15 minutes of landing.</p>

          <h2>Ground Transportation Comparison: Why Choose Professional Car Service?</h2>
          <p>When you land at JFK, you have multiple ground transportation options. Understanding the real differences—not just in price, but in reliability, comfort, professionalism, and total experience—helps you make the right choice for your needs.</p>
          
          <h3>Professional Car Service (Us)</h3>
          <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Pre-book online or by phone, receive confirmation, your chauffeur tracks your flight and waits in arrivals with name sign, assists with luggage, delivers you directly to your destination in a luxury vehicle.</p>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Guaranteed availability, fixed pricing (no surge), flight tracking, meet-and-greet service, professional chauffeur who knows the area, clean luxury vehicle every time, all-inclusive pricing (tolls, parking, gratuity included), door-to-door service, productive or relaxing travel time, child car seats available, luggage assistance.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Business travelers, families with luggage/children, anyone who values reliability and wants to know their transportation is handled, travelers arriving at odd hours, people unfamiliar with New York, anyone who wants to work or relax during the ride.</p>
          <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $136 for a sedan to NYC, all-inclusive. Know your cost before you book.</p>
          
          <h3>Rideshare (Uber/Lyft)</h3>
          <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Open app after landing, request ride, wait for driver to accept and navigate to airport, meet at designated rideshare pickup area (often requiring shuttle bus or long walk), hope for decent vehicle.</p>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Convenient app-based booking, can be inexpensive during off-peak times.</p>
          <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Surge pricing during peak times (early morning, evening, bad weather, events) can make it more expensive than professional service, availability not guaranteed (drivers can decline during busy times), vehicle quality varies wildly (might be immaculate, might not be), driver familiarity with area varies, driver might be using GPS for first time on your route, no flight tracking (you wait for them), no meet-and-greet (you find the pickup area), no luggage assistance, gratuity extra and awkward, difficult with multiple passengers or lots of luggage.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Solo travelers with light luggage during off-peak times who don't mind unpredictability.</p>
          <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $81-$244 depending on surge pricing (1x to 3x), plus tolls, plus tip.</p>
          
          <h3>Taxi</h3>
          <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Join taxi queue at designated taxi stand, wait your turn (can be 5-30 minutes), take next available taxi.</p>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> No reservation needed, fixed meter rates (usually), always available.</p>
          <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Long waits during busy times, vehicle cleanliness varies dramatically, driver knowledge varies, no flight tracking or meet-and-greet, cramped with luggage, no child car seats, cash or card (card machines "broken" surprisingly often), gratuity expected but not included.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Spontaneous travelers who don't mind waiting and don't have heavy luggage.</p>
          <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $95-$122 plus tolls plus 15-20% tip.</p>
          
          <h3>Rental Car</h3>
          <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Take rental car shuttle to off-airport lot, wait in line, complete paperwork, inspect and accept vehicle, navigate unfamiliar area to destination, deal with parking.</p>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Have vehicle for duration of trip, can be economical for longer stays.</p>
          <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Time-consuming pickup process (30-60 minutes), navigation in unfamiliar city, parking costs and hassles in New York, insurance decisions, fuel requirements, return process, not productive travel time (you're driving).</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Multi-day trips where you'll need a car throughout your stay.</p>
          <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $40-$120/day plus gas, tolls, parking, insurance.</p>
          
          <h3>Airport Shuttle/Shared Van</h3>
          <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Book shared shuttle, van makes multiple stops at different hotels/addresses, wait for other passengers, extended travel time.</p>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Economical for solo travelers.</p>
          <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Multiple stops add 30-90 minutes to journey, rigid schedules, share space with strangers, limited luggage capacity, cannot deviate from scheduled stops.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Solo budget travelers with lots of time and going to a major hotel.</p>
          <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $25-$45 per person, but takes 2-3x longer than direct service.</p>
          
          <h3>Public Transportation</h3>
          <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Navigate to train/bus station in airport, purchase tickets, manage luggage on crowded transit, transfer to connecting lines, walk from final stop to destination.</p>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Very economical, operates on frequent schedules.</p>
          <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Difficult with luggage, time-consuming with connections and waits, requires familiarity with system, uncomfortable with bags and fellow passengers, limited hours on some lines, not door-to-door, impossible for families with young children and luggage.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Solo budget travelers with backpack only who know the transit system.</p>
          <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $5-$20, but requires significant time and effort.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> For most travelers—especially business travelers, families, or anyone arriving with checked luggage—professional car service provides the best combination of reliability, comfort, and value. The modest price premium over rideshare (when rideshare isn't surging) buys you guaranteed availability, professional service, and peace of mind.</p>

          <h3>What's Included—Everything</h3>
          <p>When we say all-inclusive, we mean it. Every JFK airport transfer includes:</p>

          </ul>
          
          <h3>No Hidden Fees, No Surprises</h3>
          <p>Some transportation companies advertise low base rates then add fees for everything: tolls extra, parking extra, fuel surcharge, airport fee, gratuity not included, wait time charges. When you're done, that "$70" fare is actually $130. We don't play that game.</p>
          
          <p>The price we quote includes absolutely everything. If we quote $136 for your trip, you pay $136. Your credit card is charged exactly that amount. No surprises on your statement, no unexpected fees, no additional charges when the ride is complete.</p>

          <h2>Travel Time from Different New York Areas to JFK</h2>
          <p>John F. Kennedy International is located approximately 15 mi from central New York. However, travel time varies significantly based on your specific location, time of day, and day of week. Understanding realistic travel times helps you schedule pickups appropriately and arrive at the airport with proper buffers.</p>
          
          <h3>By Time of Day</h3>
          <table class="data-table">
            <tr><th>Time of Day</th><th>From Downtown NYC</th><th>From Near Suburbs</th><th>From Distant Suburbs</th><th>Traffic Level</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Late Night / Early Morning (12 AM - 5 AM)</td><td>Fastest end of 45-90 min</td><td>20-35 min</td><td>35-55 min</td><td>Minimal traffic, optimal routes open</td></tr>

            <tr><td>Morning Rush (7 AM - 9:30 AM)</td><td>Longest 45-90 min</td><td>35-55 min</td><td>60-90 min</td><td>Heavy inbound traffic, delays likely</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Midday (9:30 AM - 3:30 PM)</td><td>Middle 45-90 min</td><td>28-45 min</td><td>45-70 min</td><td>Moderate, generally flowing traffic</td></tr>

          </table>
          
          <h3>By Day of Week</h3>
          <p><strong>Monday-Thursday:</strong> Standard traffic patterns as described above. Rush hours are pronounced but predictable.</p>
          <p><strong>Friday:</strong> Afternoon rush starts earlier (around 2:30 PM) and lasts longer. Friday evening departures from the airport are very popular—expect heavier traffic toward JFK from 1 PM to 8 PM.</p>
          <p><strong>Saturday:</strong> Generally lighter traffic all day. Morning and midday are excellent times for airport travel. Saturday evening can see increased traffic from events and dining.</p>
          <p><strong>Sunday:</strong> Usually the lightest traffic day except Sunday evening (4 PM - 8 PM) when weekend travelers return, creating moderate congestion.</p>
          
          <h3>By Specific New York Neighborhoods</h3>
          <p><em>These estimates assume moderate traffic conditions (midday on a weekday):</em></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Downtown NYC:</strong> 45-90 min via most direct route</li>
            <li><strong>Midtown:</strong> Add 5-10 minutes to downtown time</li>
            <li><strong>East Side:</strong> Comparable to downtown, route dependent</li>
            <li><strong>West Side:</strong> Often fastest, depending on specific location</li>
            <li><strong>North NYC:</strong> Add 10-15 minutes to downtown estimates</li>
            <li><strong>South NYC:</strong> Subtract 5-10 minutes from downtown estimates</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Recommended Airport Arrival Times</h3>
          <p>TSA and most airlines recommend:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Domestic flights:</strong> Arrive 2 hours before departure</li>
            <li><strong>International flights:</strong> Arrive 3 hours before departure</li>
            <li><strong>Peak travel periods</strong> (Thanksgiving, Christmas, spring break, summer weekends): Add 30-60 minutes to standard recommendations</li>
            <li><strong>TSA PreCheck/Clear:</strong> You can cut it closer, but we still recommend 90 minutes for domestic, 2.5 hours for international</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>When you book, tell us your flight time. We'll calculate optimal pickup time based on your location, time of day, and current traffic patterns. Our goal is to get you to the airport with appropriate buffer—not stressed and rushed, but not sitting at the gate for three hours either.</p>

          <h2>Tips for First-Time Travelers to JFK</h2>
          <p>If this is your first time flying through John F. Kennedy International, here's what you should know to make your experience smooth:</p>
          
          <h3>Before Your Trip</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Book car service in advance:</strong> Don't wait until you land and hope for the best with rideshare. Book at least 24-48 hours ahead for guaranteed availability and the best rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Provide your flight details:</strong> When booking, give us your airline and flight number. This lets us track your flight automatically and know exactly which terminal you'll be in.</li>

            <li><strong>Have a backup plan:</strong> Save our phone number in your contacts. If something unexpected happens, you can call or text our dispatch team 24/7.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Upon Arrival</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Turn on your phone:</strong> As soon as you land, turn off airplane mode. You'll receive a text from your chauffeur confirming they're positioned and ready.</li>
            <li><strong>Collect your luggage efficiently:</strong> If you checked bags, head directly to baggage claim. Don't stop for long restroom breaks or meals before getting bags—your chauffeur is waiting. Grab your bags, then take care of other needs if necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow ground transportation signs:</strong> Every terminal has clear signage to "Ground Transportation" or "Arrivals." Follow these signs to reach the area where your chauffeur is waiting.</li>
            <li><strong>Look for your name sign:</strong> Your chauffeur will be holding a professional sign with your name clearly displayed. They're usually near the main exit or in a central location visible from multiple angles.</li>
            <li><strong>If you can't find your chauffeur:</strong> Don't panic. Call or text the number from your confirmation. They'll guide you to their exact position. Sometimes you're looking at different exits or they've been asked to reposition by airport staff.</li>
            <li><strong>Let your chauffeur handle luggage:</strong> That's what they're there for. They'll assist with your bags to the vehicle.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>During the Ride</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Confirm your destination:</strong> When you get in the vehicle, confirm your destination address with the chauffeur. This ensures you're both on the same page.</li>
            <li><strong>Work or relax:</strong> Use the WiFi if you need to work or check email. Or just relax—you're not driving, you don't need to navigate, you can decompress from your flight.</li>
            <li><strong>Ask questions:</strong> Our chauffeurs know New York intimately. If you're visiting and want restaurant recommendations, directions to attractions, or local insights, just ask.</li>
            <li><strong>No cash needed:</strong> Everything is pre-paid through your booking. No fumbling for cash, no worrying about having small bills for tips. Just enjoy the ride.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>For Departures</h3>

            <li><strong>Be ready:</strong> Your chauffeur will arrive about 5 minutes before your scheduled pickup. Being ready to go avoids delays.</li>
            <li><strong>Know your terminal and airline:</strong> For departures, make sure you've told us your airline. We'll drop you at the correct terminal entrance.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan for traffic:</strong> Even though we build in appropriate buffer time, construction or accidents can happen. Booking pickups during off-peak hours when possible provides extra margin.</li>
            <li><strong>TSA PreCheck/Clear:</strong> If you have these, mention it when booking. We can adjust timing since you'll move through security faster.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>2 hours before landing:</strong> If your flight is on time, your chauffeur receives trip details and begins preparing.</p>
          
          <p><strong>1 hour before landing:</strong> Your chauffeur departs for JFK, timing arrival to coincide with your landing plus expected time to deplane and collect bags.</p>
          
          <p><strong>30 minutes before landing:</strong> You receive a text message with your chauffeur's name, photo, phone number, and vehicle details.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Upon landing:</strong> Your chauffeur is positioned in your terminal's arrivals area with a professional name sign.</p>
          
          <p><strong>During bag claim and customs (if international):</strong> Your chauffeur waits. This is covered by your included wait time—no extra charges.</p>
          
          <p><strong>When you arrive in ground transportation area:</strong> Look for your name sign. Your chauffeur will see you and approach to confirm your identity.</p>

          <h3>For Departures: What Happens Step-by-Step</h3>
          <p><strong>When you book:</strong> Tell us your flight time, airline, and pickup location. We calculate optimal pickup time based on distance, time of day, and typical traffic, then add appropriate buffer for TSA, check-in, and unexpected delays.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Evening before departure:</strong> You receive confirmation via email and text with pickup time and chauffeur assignment.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Morning of departure (or evening for late flights):</strong> Your chauffeur confirms they're on schedule via our dispatch system.</p>
          
          <p><strong>15 minutes before pickup:</strong> Your chauffeur arrives at your location and texts you that they're ready.</p>
          
          <p><strong>At pickup time:</strong> You come out with luggage. Your chauffeur loads bags, you confirm airline/terminal, and you depart.</p>
          
          <p><strong>During the trip:</strong> Chauffeur monitors traffic and adjusts route if needed. You're kept informed of any delays or issues.</p>
          
          <p><strong>At JFK:</strong> Your chauffeur delivers you to your airline's terminal at departures curb, unloads luggage, and ensures you're set before departing.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Curbside check-in tip:</strong> Most airlines offer curbside bag check at JFK for a small fee ($2-3 per bag). This can save significant time compared to indoor check-in during busy periods.</p>

          <h2>Special Situations and Requests</h2>
          
          <h3>Child Car Seats and Booster Seats</h3>
          <p>Traveling with children requires appropriate car seats based on age, weight, and height. We provide complimentary car seats and booster seats—just specify the ages of children traveling when you book. We'll install appropriate seats before pickup:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Rear-facing infant seats:</strong> For children under 2 years or under 30 lbs</li>
            <li><strong>Forward-facing car seats:</strong> For children 2-4 years or 30-65 lbs</li>
            <li><strong>Booster seats:</strong> For children 4-8 years or until they reach 4'9" height</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles</h3>
          <p>We maintain wheelchair accessible vehicles in our fleet for passengers requiring mobility assistance. These vehicles feature ramps or lifts and can accommodate standard wheelchairs and most mobility scooters. Request accessible vehicles when booking and provide details about the mobility equipment to ensure proper vehicle assignment.</p>
          
          <h3>Excessive Luggage or Special Items</h3>
          <p>Standard luggage capacity: sedans fit 3 large suitcases, SUVs fit 6, Sprinters fit 14+. If you're traveling with more bags than typical, golf clubs, skis, musical instruments, or other oversized items, mention this when booking. We'll ensure the appropriate vehicle is assigned or make arrangements for equipment that doesn't fit in standard configurations.</p>
          
          <h3>Group Travel</h3>
          <p>For groups of 4+ passengers, SUVs work well. For 6-14 passengers, Sprinter vans provide executive comfort with individual seating, WiFi, and luggage capacity. For groups larger than 14, we can coordinate multiple vehicles with synchronized pickups.</p>
          
          <h3>Pets</h3>
          <p>Well-behaved pets in carriers are welcome in most of our vehicles. Larger dogs or multiple pets require advance notice so we can assign appropriate vehicles and chauffeurs comfortable with animals. Service animals are always welcome without restriction.</p>
          
          <h3>Late-Night and Early-Morning Pickups</h3>
          <p>We operate 24/7 with the same service standards regardless of time. 3 AM airport pickup? 11 PM landing? We've got you covered. Some chauffeurs specifically prefer overnight shifts—you're not getting someone exhausted at the end of a long day.</p>

          <h2>Why Choose Our JFK Airport Service Over Alternatives</h2>
          
          <h3>Guaranteed Availability</h3>
          <p>When you book with us, your ride is confirmed. No surge pricing making cars scarce, no drivers canceling because they got a better fare, no wondering if transportation will actually be there. Your chauffeur will be waiting. This guarantee is especially valuable during weather events, major holidays, peak travel periods, and odd hours when rideshare is unreliable.</p>
          
          <h3>Automatic Flight Tracking</h3>
          <p>We monitor your flight from the moment it departs to the moment it lands. Delays, early arrivals, gate changes, diversions—we track it all. Your chauffeur adjusts automatically. You never need to call us or worry that your driver left because your flight was late. This is standard for every airport pickup we do.</p>
          
          <h3>Professional Chauffeurs, Not Gig Workers</h3>
          <p>Our chauffeurs are full-time professionals who have chosen this as their career. They're not between jobs, not earning side income, not learning as they go. They're licensed commercial drivers with clean records, extensive background checks, professional training, and years of experience navigating New York. They know JFK intimately, know the fastest routes at different times of day, and understand that their job is to make your experience excellent.</p>
          
          <h3>Consistent Vehicle Quality</h3>
          <p>You won't wonder what kind of car is showing up. Every vehicle in our fleet is a late-model luxury car (Mercedes E-Class, BMW 5 Series, or better for sedans; Cadillac Escalade or Lincoln Navigator for SUVs; Mercedes Sprinter for vans). Every vehicle is professionally detailed before each pickup, inspected daily, and maintained to exacting standards. You'll never get in a car and wonder about that stain or that smell.</p>
          
          <h3>True All-Inclusive Pricing</h3>
          <p>The price we quote is the exact price you pay. We include tolls, parking, gratuity, fuel, and everything else. No surprise fees appear on your credit card statement. No awkward tipping decisions at the end. No wondering if you're being overcharged. Complete transparency from quote to completion.</p>
          
          <h3>Meet-and-Greet Service</h3>
          <p>Your chauffeur doesn't wait in a parking lot for you to find them. They're inside the terminal, in the arrivals area, with a professional sign displaying your name. This is standard for every airport pickup—not an expensive add-on, not a premium service tier, just how we operate.</p>
          
          <h3>Real Customer Support</h3>
          <p>If something goes wrong or you have questions, you can call our dispatch team 24/7 and reach an actual person who can help. Not a chatbot, not an automated system that tells you to consult the app, not a call center in another country reading scripts. A real person, in New York, who knows our operation and can solve problems.</p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About JFK Airport Service</h2>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">How do I find my driver when I arrive at JFK?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Your chauffeur will be waiting in the arrivals area of your terminal with a professional sign displaying your name. Before your flight lands, you'll receive a text message with their photo, name, and direct phone number. After collecting your luggage, follow signs to "Ground Transportation" or "Arrivals" and look for your name sign. If you can't locate them, call or text the number provided—they'll guide you to their exact position. They're inside the terminal, not outside in a parking area.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What happens if my flight to JFK is delayed?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">We track all flights automatically using real-time flight data. If your flight is delayed, we know before you do and automatically adjust your pickup time. Your chauffeur will be positioned when you actually land, not when you were originally scheduled to arrive. You don't need to call us or notify us—the adjustment happens automatically. This is standard for every airport pickup.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">How much wait time is included if I'm delayed getting bags or going through customs?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">We include 60 minutes of complimentary wait time for international arrivals and 30 minutes for domestic arrivals. This time starts when your plane lands (not when it was scheduled to land). This gives you ample time to deplane, collect checked luggage, clear customs if international, use the restroom, and meet your chauffeur without any rush or extra charges. If exceptional circumstances cause delays beyond this, just text your chauffeur—we're reasonable about delays outside your control.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Can I be picked up at a specific terminal at JFK?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Yes, and this happens automatically. When you provide your airline and flight number during booking, we know exactly which terminal you'll be in. Your chauffeur will be positioned in that specific terminal's arrivals area. Different airlines use different terminals at JFK, and our chauffeurs know the layout of each one.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Do you provide child car seats for airport transfers?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Yes, we provide complimentary car seats and booster seats. When booking, tell us the ages and approximate weights of children traveling. We'll install appropriate safety seats before pickup: rear-facing infant seats for children under 2, forward-facing car seats for ages 2-4, and booster seats for ages 4-8. These are professional-grade seats that meet all safety standards, cleaned and inspected before each use.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What if I have lots of luggage—will it fit?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Standard capacity: sedans accommodate 3 large suitcases plus carry-ons, SUVs handle 6 large suitcases plus carry-ons, and Sprinter vans fit 14+ large suitcases plus carry-ons. If you're traveling with excessive luggage, golf clubs, skis, oversized equipment, or multiple passengers with full bags each, mention this when booking. We'll ensure the appropriate vehicle is assigned. It's better to tell us upfront than discover at pickup that everything doesn't fit.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Can I book a round-trip airport transfer?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Absolutely. Booking both your arrival pickup and departure drop-off together is common. We'll track both flights (for arrival) and ensure you have reliable transportation in both directions. Round-trip bookings often receive preferential rates compared to booking two one-way trips separately.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">How far in advance should I book JFK airport service?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">We recommend booking 24-48 hours in advance for standard trips. This ensures availability of your preferred vehicle type and allows us to assign chauffeurs efficiently. During peak travel periods (Thanksgiving, Christmas, spring break, major summer weekends), book as far ahead as possible—2 weeks isn't too early. Same-day bookings are often possible depending on current availability, but advance booking guarantees your transportation is secured.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What's your cancellation policy for airport transfers?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Cancellations made 24 or more hours before scheduled pickup receive a full refund. Cancellations within 24 hours are subject to a cancellation fee (typically 50% of the fare). No-shows or cancellations within 2 hours of pickup are charged the full fare. We understand that travel plans change—just let us know as soon as possible. For flight cancellations by the airline, we work with you to reschedule or refund without penalties.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Can someone else book car service for me?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Yes, this is very common. Executive assistants book for executives, family members book for visiting relatives, companies book for clients or candidates. When booking, provide the passenger's name (this goes on the name sign), their flight details, and their contact phone number. The passenger will receive trip confirmations and chauffeur details directly, while the booker receives confirmation and can track the trip.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Do you serve all areas of New York for JFK airport transfers?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Yes, we provide comprehensive service throughout the entire New York metropolitan area. Downtown, suburbs, neighboring cities—if it's within reasonable distance of New York, we serve it. Enter your specific address in our online booking form for an instant quote, or contact us if you're not sure whether we serve your location.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-question">Is service available 24/7 for odd-hour flights?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Yes, we operate around the clock, every day of the year. Late-night arrivals, early-morning departures, overnight red-eye flights—we have chauffeurs available 24/7. Service standards are identical regardless of time. You're not getting someone exhausted at the end of their shift for a 3 AM pickup—we have chauffeurs who specifically work overnight hours.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What if I need to make a stop between the airport and my destination?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Additional stops can be accommodated for a small additional fee. Common requests include stopping at a office to drop off a colleague, stopping at a grocery store, or stopping at a restaurant for takeout. Just mention the stop when booking or ask your chauffeur during the trip. For multiple stops or complex itineraries, hourly service may be more economical than point-to-point with stop fees.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Can I track my ride or my chauffeur's location?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">You'll receive text updates when your chauffeur is assigned and when they're positioned at the airport for pickup. For departures, you'll receive a text when they're en route to your pickup location. If you need real-time tracking or updates, you can call or text your chauffeur directly using the number provided in your confirmation.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Do you offer wheelchair accessible vehicles for JFK airport service?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Yes, we have wheelchair accessible vehicles with ramps or lifts. When booking, request an accessible vehicle and provide details about the wheelchair or mobility scooter (dimensions, weight) to ensure we assign the appropriate vehicle. These vehicles should be booked as far in advance as possible as we have limited accessible fleet compared to standard vehicles.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">We accept all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover) and corporate accounts with approved billing. Payment is processed when you book, so there's no payment required at the time of service—your chauffeur won't ask for payment or handle money. Corporate accounts can be invoiced monthly with net-30 terms.</p>
