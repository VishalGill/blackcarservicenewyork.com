          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">How do I book a ride?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">You can book online through our website for instant confirmation, or contact us for complex itineraries and special requests. Online booking provides immediate quotes based on your pickup location, destination, vehicle type, and timing.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">How far in advance should I book?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">For standard trips, we recommend booking at least 24 hours in advance. During peak travel seasons, holidays, and major New York events, book 48-72 hours or more ahead. For special occasions like weddings, book 1-2 weeks or more in advance. Same-day service is often available—check online or contact us.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Can I book for someone else?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Yes. Many clients book for colleagues, clients, family members, and guests. Simply provide the passenger's name, contact information, and any special requirements. The passenger will receive trip details directly.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Can I modify or cancel my reservation?</h3>

          </div>

          <h2>Pricing & Payment</h2>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What's included in the quoted price?</h3>

          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Do you have surge pricing?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">No. The price we quote is the price you pay, regardless of weather, events, or demand. We don't multiply rates like rideshare apps.</p>
          </div>

            <p class="faq-answer">We track all flights in real-time. If your flight is delayed, we automatically adjust your pickup time. Your chauffeur will be there when you actually land, not when you were originally scheduled to arrive. There's no need to call us.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-question">Where do I meet my driver at the airport?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Your chauffeur will be waiting in the arrivals area with a sign displaying your name. Before landing, you'll receive a text with your chauffeur's photo, name, and direct phone number. If you can't locate them, call or text that number.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">How much wait time is included for airport pickups?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">We include 60 minutes of complimentary wait time for international arrivals and 30 minutes for domestic. This starts when your plane lands, giving you time for customs, baggage claim, and restroom stops.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What if my flight is cancelled?</h3>
